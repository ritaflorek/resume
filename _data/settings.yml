# Personal statement
personal_statement: 
  I’m a generalist and technological do-it-your-self’er, who is passionate about web development, data computation, visuals and programming. My formal education was at the Kiev National Economic University, where I graduated in 2010.

  <br><br>

  My interests outside of web development have taken me far afield, including years-long dalliances into film making and data analysis, both of which continue to inform my work in front-end, data management and overall professional life.

  <br><br>

  During my free time, I like to drink caffeine and get back to work.
